To enable it, add the following dependency to your application.

dependency:micronaut-microstream-rest[groupId="{projectGroup}",scope="developmentOnly"]

You also need to enable it in your configuration, as for security it is disabled by default.

[configuration]
----
microstream:
  rest:
    enabled: true
----

Outputs a warning each time your application is started – if the REST endpoint is enabled – that this should not be deployed to production.
