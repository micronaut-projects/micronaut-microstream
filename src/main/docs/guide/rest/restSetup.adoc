To enable it, add the following dependency to your application.

dependency:micronaut-microstream-rest[groupId="{projectGroup}",scope="developmentOnly"]

You also need to enable it in your configuration, as for security it is disabled by default.

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
microstream:
  rest:
    enabled: true
----

It will output a warning each time your application is started if the REST endpoint is enabled that this should not be deployed to production.
