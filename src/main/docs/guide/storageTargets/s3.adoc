Configuration of an S3 storage target requires a https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#s3[S3Client bean to be defined].

The configuration can then be defined as follows:

[configuration]
----
microstream:
    s3:
        storage:
            default:                               # <1>
                bucket-name: microstream           # <2>
                root-class: com.example.model.Root # <3>
----
<1> The name for the created Storage Manager
<2> The name of the S3 bucket to use for storage
<3> The root class of the object graph to store
