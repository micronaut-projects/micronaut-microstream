https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] exposes the status of the MicroStream Instances in your Micronaut Application.

After you add the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#management[`management`] dependency,
the `/health` endpoint of a Micronaut application with one MicroStream instance named `blue` will return:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "application",
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "microstream.blue": {
      "name": "application",
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "startingUp": false,
        "running": true,
        "active": true,
        "acceptingTasks": true,
        "shuttingDown": false,
        "shutdown": false
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
----

NOTE: By default, the details visible above are only shown to authenticated users. See the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] documentation for how to configure that setting.

If you wish to disable the MicroStream health check while still using the `management` dependency you can set the property `endpoints.health.microstream.enabled` to `false` in your application configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    microstream:
      enabled: false
