If caching that persists across restarts is required, you can first define a storage manager:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::test-suite/src/test/resources/application-cache.yml[]
----

<1> Define a storage manager called `backing`
<2> Define a cache called `counter` which uses this storage manager to store Strings keys and Long values
