To use the MicroStream cache abstraction, you must declare a dependency on

dependency:micronaut-microstream-cache[groupId="io.micronaut.microstream"]

You can then define a cache by adding the following configuration to your application:

[configuration]
----
include::test-suite/src/test/resources/application-cache.yml[]
----

- Define a cache named `counter` which has String keys and Long values.

This cache can then be used via the following:

snippet::io.micronaut.microstream.docs.CounterService[]

<1> Use the `counter` cache.
<2> The result of this call will be cached.
<3> Setting the counter will invalidate the cache for this key.
