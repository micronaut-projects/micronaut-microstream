You can inject the `EmbeddedStorageManager` and retrieve the Root Instance:

snippet::io.micronaut.microstream.docs.CustomerRepositoryImpl[]

<1> If your Micronaut application has only a single Microstream Instance, you don't need to specify a name qualifier to inject `EmbeddedStorageManager`.
<2> When you are https://docs.microstream.one/manual/storage/root-instances.html#_shared_mutable_data[working with Microstream technology in a multi-threaded environment],
reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized.
