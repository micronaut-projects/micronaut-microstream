The following example shows how an equivalent implementation which leverages the ann:microstream.annotation.Store[] annotation to simplify object storage.

snippet::io.micronaut.microstream.docs.CustomerRepositoryStoreImpl[tags=clazz]

<1> You can also inject an instance of api:microstream.RootProvider[] to easily access the Microstream Root Instance. If your Micronaut application has only a single Microstream Instance, you don't need to specify a name qualifier to inject it.
<2> https://docs.microstream.one/manual/storage/storing-data/index.html[The rule is: "The Object that has been modified has to be stored!".].
<3> https://docs.microstream.one/manual/storage/storing-data/index.html[To store a newly created object, store the "owner" of the object].

NOTE: ann:microstream.annotation.Store[] only works for synchronous methods. It does not do any logic for methods returning a `Publisher` or a `CompletableFuture`. For those scenarios, use directly the `StorageManager`.
