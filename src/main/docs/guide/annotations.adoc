Micronaut MicroStream ships the following around method annotations.
They simplify storing objects in an associated Store Manager.

These annotations wrap the decorated method to ensure thread isolation.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| ann:microstream.annotations.StoreParams[]
| It stores the method parameters specified in the annotation value.

| ann:microstream.annotations.StoreReturn[]
| It stores the method return

| ann:microstream.annotations.StoreRoot[]
| It stores the root object.

| ann:microstream.annotations.Store[]
| Micronaut MicroStream maps other annotations to this annotation. You will not use this annotation directly.
|===

If you work with multiple MicroStream instances, you can supply the name qualifier to the annotation to specify the instance you are working with.

Moreover, you can specify the api:microstream.annotations.StoringStrategy[] via the annotations. By default, `LAZY` is the default storing mode.
